# UltralightSource
The goal is to create a repository of data on ultralight and lightweight backpacking gear. It will be accessible by anyone with an account and they will be able to query the data and export it. Selected users will be able to alter the data. An API will allow integration with other applications. It is non-commerical and open-source.
